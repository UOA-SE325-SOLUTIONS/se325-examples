- **[Archive 2024 S2](./archive-2024-s2/)**: Contains old examples used as of _2024 Semester Two_. I have kept these here for your interest; however, many of these use old / outdated libraries that either have large updates or are not taught in the course anymore (e.g. JAX-RS is replaced with SpringBoot from 2025, and Hibernate / JPA annotations have been moved to later versions with `jakarta.persistence.*` packages rather than `javax.persistence.*`).
