This repository contains example code demonstrating various concepts introduced in SOFTENG 325 at the University of Auckland.

## Index

- *[Example 01](./example-01-tcp)*: Contains a simple example of how to send raw data over a TCP connection.

- *[Example 02](./example-02-java-serialization)*: Contains an example of how to serialize Java objects and send them across a network connection or convert them into a byte array.

- *[Example 03](./example-03-servlets)*: Contains an example of a simple Java Servlet.

- *[Example 04](./example-04-soap-jax-ws)*: Contains a simple "hello world" SOAP service written in Java.

- *[Example 05](./example-05-jax-rs)*: Contains two REST services written using JAX-RS.

- *[Example 06](./example-06-json-with-jackson)*: Contains several examples showing how to use Jackson to serialize / deserialize JSON from our Java programs.

- *[Example 07](./example-07-jaxrs-custom-serialization)*: Extends our parolee service running example with support for a custom data format - Java serialization.

- *[Example 08](./example-08-jaxrs-json)*: Extends our parolee service running example with support for JSON, without having to manually write out JSON strings.

- *[Example 09](./example-09-jpa-intro)*: A simple example showing JPA and Hibernate usage.

- *[Example 10](./example-10-auction-jpa)*: A much more complex JPA / Hibernate example, showing entity-entity relationships of various cardinalities, inheritance, and several examples of different kinds of JPQL queries.

- *[Example 11](./example-11-parolee-nojpa)*: A more thoroughly implemented Parolee web service. Written without JPA / Hibernate, for comparison with example 12 below.

- *[Example 12](./example-12-parolee-with-jpa)*: Identical to example 11, but uses JPA / Hibernate for persistence.
