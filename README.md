# SOFTENG 325 Examples Repository

This repository contains example code demonstrating various concepts introduced in SOFTENG 325 at the University of
Auckland.

## Index

- **[Archive 2024 S2](./archive-2024-s2/)**: Contains old examples used as of _2024 Semester Two_. I have kept these here for your interest; however, many of these use old / outdated libraries that either have large updates or are not taught in the course anymore (e.g. JAX-RS is replaced with SpringBoot from 2025, and Hibernate / JPA annotations have been moved to later versions with `jakarta.persistence.*` packages rather than `javax.persistence.*`).

- **[Example 01](./example-01-tcp)**: Contains a simple example of how to send raw data over a TCP connection.

- **[Example 02](./example-02-java-serialization)**: Contains an example of how to serialize Java objects and send them across a network connection or convert them into a byte array.

- **[Example 03](./example-03-servlets)**: Contains examples of simple Java Servlets.

- **[Example 04](./example-04-springboot)**: Contains a simple SpringBoot Web application with a simple REST service, along with associated unit and integration tests.

- **[Example 05](./example-05-dad-jokes)**: Contains a more advanced REST service, allowing users to create and browse dad jokes.

- **[Example 06](./example-06-json-with-jackson)**: Contains standalone examples of how the Jackson library can be used to convert between Java objects and JSON.

- **[Example 07](./example-07-springboot-other-data-types)**: Shows how we can support data types other than JSON within our Spring apps.

- **[Example 08](./example-08-jpa-intro)**: An introduction to JPA / Hibernate, without SpringBoot.

- **[Example 09](./example-09-jpa-springboot)**: An introduction to Spring Data JPA, which integrates JPA / Hibernate into SpringBoot applications and provides convenience in the form of easier configuration and querying using Spring Data Repositories.
